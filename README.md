## Proposed Components

In this app, I learnt to use React with React Router DOM alongside tests with React Testing Library.
In the future, I would look into context API to prevent prop drilling which occured a lot in this project.

I was able to write and pass tests for small components; however, for larger componenets, I had to rely on
toMatchSnapshot methods.

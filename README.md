## Proposed Components

In this app, I learnt to use React with React Router DOM alongside tests with React Testing Library.
After further reading, I believe that context API could have been used in shopping cart component from App Component, 
and it would have prevented props drilling, which occured frequqently in this project.

I was able to write and pass tests for small components; however, for larger componenets, I had to rely on
toMatchSnapshot methods.

I was also motivated to learn SASS or styled components, as it is obvious I am going to need it for larger projects.

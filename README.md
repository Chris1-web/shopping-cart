## Proposed Components

In this app, I learnt to use React with React Router DOM alongside tests

I was able to write and pass tests for small components; however, for larger componenets, I had to rely on
toMatchSnapshot methods.

App
-----Nav
-----Home
-----Products
----------Product Container
----------Product card
----------Cart
-------------Header
-------------Cart Container
---------------Cart Card
---------------Checkout
